This is a Ruby Gem, built using Bundler.  For a walkthrough of how that works, see http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler.

== Notes

* `rake install` builds and installs the gem, but you'll probably need to do `sudo rake install`.
* Keep in mind that the gemspec only looks at files in the VCS (git).

== Guidelines

* Whenever possible, retain compatibility with Ruby 1.8.
